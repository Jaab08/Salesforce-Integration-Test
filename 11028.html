<h1>Why am I seeing multiple charges each month? Updating</h1>

<p>If you're seeing multiple charges each month, you might have multiple accounts (each with an active subscription).</p>

<h3>To find multiple accounts...</h3>

<p>To see if you have more than one account, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open HBO&nbsp;Max on each device that you use (phone, tablet, TV, computer).</li>
<li>Do one of the following:
<ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Phone or tablet</strong>: Tap your profile (upper right), the Settings icon <img src='https://hbomaxmedia.blob.core.windows.net/images/test/settings.svg' alt='(cog, upper right)' />, and then find or tap <strong>Account</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Computer</strong>: Choose your profile (upper right), then choose <strong>Settings</strong>, and find <strong>Account</strong>. </li>
<li><strong>TV device</strong>: Choose the Settings icon <img src='https://hbomaxmedia.blob.core.windows.net/images/test/settings.svg' alt='(cog, lower left)' /> and then choose <strong>Account</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take note of your account email address.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Signed in with multiple email addresses?</h3>

<p>If you find more than one email address, then you have multiple HBO&nbsp;Max accounts. To fix this, for each account go to Subscription to find out who's billing you (see <a href="/Answer/Detail/000001195">Who's billing me?</a>).</p>

<p>Once you know who's billing you, you can decide which subscription you want to cancel (see <a href="/Answer/Detail/000001191">How do I cancel?</a>).</p>
