 <div class="collapsibletitle">When and how will I be charged?</div>
 <div class="collapsiblebody">

	<p>When you start your free trial, you need to add a payment method during sign up so your subscription can automatically convert to a paid subscription after your trial ends. Your first charge is typically after your free trial is over (this can vary depending on your billing provider).</p>
	
	<p>After your free trial, your subscription will automatically renew each billing period until you cancel it. To avoid being charged for your next billing period, you need to <a href="/Answer/Detail/000002526">cancel your subscription</a> before your next billing date.</p>

 <div class="collapsibletitle">Why was I charged for a free trial?</div>
 <div class="collapsiblebody">

	<p>If you're charged after starting a free trial, here are a few possible reasons:</p>

	<ul class="bullet">
		<li><strong>Offer doesn't include a free trial</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your subscription plan or promotional offer doesn't include a free trial, you'll be charged for Max at the time you sign up.</li>
		<li><strong>Not eligible for a free trial</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't meet the eligibility criteria for the subscription plan or promotional offer with a free trial, you’ll be charged for Max at the time of sign up. For example, some promotional offers are only available to new subscribers. If you think you were incorrectly billed, reach out to your billing provider for help (see <strong>Who's billing me?</strong> below).</li>
		<li><strong>Authorization hold</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pending charge is likely an authorization hold. An authorization hold is done to make sure your payment method is valid and can be successfully charged in the future (once your free trial is over).<br />
		An authorization hold is temporary and should be removed within 7-10 days, depending on your financial institution's policies. The authorization hold is not a charge, but may affect your available balance. You can contact your financial institution to find out when the authorization hold will be removed, and when the hold amount will be added back to your available balance.</li>
